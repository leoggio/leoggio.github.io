<h1> Fun Facts</h1>
<li>  It was around the 7th century that royal courts in the Middle Eastern Muslim world started to use the fork on the dining table.<br></li>
<li>In another century, they were passed on to the Byzantine world, where the use of forks at the dining table became symbolic in wealthy and noble families</li>
<li>The Fork came to the English notice by a man called Thomas Coryate, who brought forks to England in 1608.</li>
<li> According to the very entertaining book Ancient Inventions by Peter James and Nick Thorpe, the fork was probably invented in the Eastern Roman Empire of Byzantium where forks were first used during the 4th century AD.</li>
