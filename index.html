      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>The word fork comes from the Latin furca, meaning "pitchfork". <br>
	      Some of the earliest known uses of forks with food occurred in Ancient Egypt, where large forks were used as cooking utensils.<br>
	   A fork, in cutlery or kitchenware, is a tool consisting of a handle with several narrow tines on one end <br>.
	      The usually metal utensil is used to lift food to the mouth or to hold ingredients in place while they are being cut by a knife. <br>
